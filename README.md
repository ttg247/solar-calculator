# ☀️ Solar Calculator App

The **Solar Calculator App** helps users estimate the total energy consumption of their household by allowing them to list all their electrical appliances. Based on standardized energy ratings, the app calculates the daily and monthly energy requirements, providing insights to guide solar system planning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add household appliances with quantity and usage hours
- 📊 Calculate daily and monthly energy consumption (in Wh/kWh)
- 📦 Uses standardized power ratings for common appliances
- 📱 Simple, user-friendly interface
- ☁️ Ideal for planning solar panel installations and inverter capacity

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user selects appliances from a predefined list or adds custom ones.
2. **Usage Data**: For each appliance, the user provides:
   - Quantity
   - Average daily usage (in hours)
3. **Calculation**: The app multiplies:
4. **Total Energy Requirement** is shown:
- Daily Total (Wh or kWh)
- Monthly Total (estimated)

## 📚 Example

| Appliance     | Quantity | Hours/Day | Power Rating | Daily Usage (Wh) |
|---------------|----------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| TV            | 1        | 5         | 100 W         | 500 Wh           |
| Fan           | 2        | 10        | 75 W          | 1,500 Wh         |
| Refrigerator  | 1        | 24        | 150 W         | 3,600 Wh         |

**Total Daily Consumption**: `5,600 Wh` (5.6 kWh)
